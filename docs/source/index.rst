Welcome to BACTpipe's documentation!
====================================

BACTpipe is a complete pipeline for assembly of whole genome sequenced
bacterial isolates.

BACTpipe can use a known reference genome to order and annotate assembled
contigs, as well as assemble genomes of unknown species and automatically
determine the best reference genome to use for contig ordering and annotation.
